# FRM-Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the *Financial Risk Analysis and Management (FRAM)* course.  
The objective is to analyze borrower-level credit risk using financial data, stress-testing scenarios, and quantitative risk metrics.

The project focuses on understanding how borrower risk profiles change under stressed conditions and identifying vulnerable exposures.

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions must assess credit risk not only under normal conditions but also under adverse economic scenarios.  
This project evaluates borrower sensitivity to stress scenarios using financial ratios and statistical analysis.

## Data Description
- Borrower-level financial data
- Stress testing scenarios provided as part of the coursework  

> **Note:** The dataset was provided for academic use and cannot be shared publicly.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Financial ratio-based risk assessment
- Stress testing under multiple scenarios
- Interpretation of borrower risk sensitivity

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
